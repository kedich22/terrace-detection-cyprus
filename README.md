# Automatic detection and classification of agricultural terraces at large scales: a case study of Cyprus

This repository contains the code and workflow used in the paper  
**"Automatic detection and classification of agricultural terraces at large scales: a case study of Cyprus."**

The study focuses on large-scale, object-based detection and classification of agricultural terraces using freely available geospatial data and machine-learning-based detection and classification.  
It provides the scripts used for preprocessing, segmentation, model training, and prediction.
